# MINST Data Set MLP Prediction Model using tensorflow  
Building a **Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) model by using Tensorflow**.<br/> 
- Reference:https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-layer-perceptron-using-tensorflow-9f3e218a4809
<br/>
Building MLP using tensorflow library to predict digit recognition algorithm based on MINST Data Set. It is assumed to be a 
good practice when a devopper wants to review Building ANN steps using tensorflow.
